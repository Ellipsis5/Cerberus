2.	.:  PROJECT DESCRIPTION  :.

	This program was designed as an effective and stealhy portknocker application
	which allows communications on a secure and covert channel.  It can be configured
	to accept any number of 'knocks' on any ports and then to open one (or multiple)
	sockets for further communications with or without authentication.
	
	Stealth is the goal of this application from network scanning techniques that
	detect open TCP ports.  The program hides from these scans by only listening for
	specific UDP packets on the specified ports.  Nmap scans cannot detect this
	program running and the knock sequence ensures that brute force cannot be used
	to access or determine whether the program is running/listening.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.	.:  HOW IT WORKS  :.

	This program functions by listening for UDP packets across 3 or more ports which
	we'll denote ports X, Y, and Z.  If the program recieves 3 properly crafted UDP
	packets on ports X, Y, and Z, in the proper order and within a set amount of time
	(T), it will then open a TCP port and listen for connections to it.  These TCP
	socket connections can be set to use the authentication method built into the
	program, or be un-authenticated (less secure, but the knock sequence should
	prevent any unauthorized access).  It can also be configured to communicate
	securely via encrypted communications.
